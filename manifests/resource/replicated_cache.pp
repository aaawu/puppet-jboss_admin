# == Defines jboss_admin::replicated_cache
#
# A replicated cache
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*queue_flush_interval*]
#   In ASYNC mode, this attribute controls how often the asynchronous thread used to flush the replication queue runs. This should be a positive integer which represents thread wakeup time in milliseconds.
#
# [*remote_timeout*]
#   In SYNC mode, the timeout (in ms) used to wait for an acknowledgment when making a remote call, after which the call is aborted and an exception is thrown.
#
# [*start*]
#   The cache start mode, which can be EAGER (immediate start) or LAZY (on-demand start).
#
# [*jndi_name*]
#   The jndi-name to which to bind this cache instance.
#
# [*batching*]
#   If enabled, the invocation batching API will be made available for this cache.
#
# [*async_marshalling*]
#   If enabled, this will cause marshalling of entries to be performed asynchronously.
#
# [*indexing*]
#   If enabled, entries will be indexed when they are added to the cache. Indexes will be updated as entries change or are removed.
#
# [*mode*]
#   Sets the clustered cache mode, ASYNC for asynchronous operation, or SYNC for synchronous operation.
#
# [*queue_size*]
#   In ASYNC mode, this attribute can be used to trigger flushing of the queue when it reaches a specific threshold.
#
