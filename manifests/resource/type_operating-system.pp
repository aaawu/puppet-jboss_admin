If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "os.version", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*_name*]
#   The operating system name. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "os.name", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
