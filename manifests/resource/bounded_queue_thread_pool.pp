# == Defines jboss_admin::bounded_queue_thread_pool
#
# A thread pool executor with a bounded queue where threads submittings tasks will not block. Such a thread pool has a core and maximum size and a specified queue length.  When a task is submitted, if the number of running threads is less than the core size, a new thread is created.  Otherwise, if there is room in the queue, the task is enqueued. Otherwise, if the number of running threads is less than the maximum size, a new thread is created. Otherwise, the task is handed off to the designated handoff executor, if one is specified.  Otherwise, the task is discarded.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*allow_core_timeout*]
#   Whether core threads may time out.
#
# [*keepalive_time*]
#   Used to specify the amount of time that pool threads should be kept running when idle; if not specified, threads will run until the executor is shut down.
#
# [*thread_factory*]
#   Specifies the name of a specific thread factory to use to create worker threads. If not defined an appropriate default thread factory will be used.
#
# [*queue_length*]
#   The queue length.
#
# [*core_threads*]
#   The core thread pool size which is smaller than the maximum pool size. If undefined, the core thread pool size is the same as the maximum thread pool size.
#
# [*max_threads*]
#   The maximum thread pool size.
#
# [*resource_name*]
#   The name of the thread pool.
#
# [*handoff_executor*]
#   An executor to delegate tasks to in the event that a task cannot be accepted. If not specified, tasks that cannot be accepted will be silently discarded.
