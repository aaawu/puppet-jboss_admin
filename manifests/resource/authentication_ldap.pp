# == Defines jboss_admin::authentication_ldap
#
# Configuration to use LDAP as the user repository.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*advanced_filter*]
#   The fully defined filter to be used to search for the user based on their entered user ID. The filter should contain a variable in the form {0} - this will be replaced with the username supplied by the user.
#
# [*allow_empty_passwords*]
#   Should empty passwords be accepted from the user being authenticated.
#
# [*base_dn*]
#   The base distinguished name to commence the search for the user.
#
# [*connection*]
#   The name of the connection to use to connect to LDAP.
#
# [*recursive*]
#   Whether the search should be recursive.
#
# [*user_dn*]
#   The name of the attribute which is the user's distinguished name.
#
# [*username_attribute*]
#   The name of the attribute to search for the user. This filter will then perform a simple search where the username entered by the user matches the attribute specified here.
