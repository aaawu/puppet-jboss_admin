# == Defines jboss_admin::write-behind_WRITE_BEHIND
#
# Configures a cache store as write-behind instead of write-through.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*flush_lock_timeout*]
#   Timeout to acquire the lock which guards the state to be flushed to the cache store periodically.
#
# [*modification_queue_size*]
#   Maximum number of entries in the asynchronous queue. When the queue is full, the store becomes write-through until it can accept new entries.
#
# [*thread_pool_size*]
#   Size of the thread pool whose threads are responsible for applying the modifications to the cache store.
#
# [*shutdown_timeout*]
#   Timeout in milliseconds to stop the cache store.
#
