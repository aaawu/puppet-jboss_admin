# == Defines jboss_admin::type_runtime
#
# The management interface for the runtime system of the Java virtual machine.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*management_spec_version*]
#   The version of the specification for the management interface implemented by the running Java virtual machine.
#
# [*vm_vendor*]
#   The Java virtual machine implementation vendor. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.vendor", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*start_time*]
#   The start time of the Java virtual machine in milliseconds.
#
# [*class_path*]
#   The Java class path that is used by the system class loader to search for class files. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.class.path", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*vm_version*]
#   The Java virtual machine implementation version. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.version", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*system_properties*]
#   A map of names and values of all system properties. If a security manager is installed and its "checkPropertiesAccess" method does not allow access to system properties, then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*object_name*]
#   String representation the object name of this platform managed object.
#
# [*library_path*]
#   The Java library path. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.library.path", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*spec_name*]
#   The Java virtual machine specification name. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.specification.name", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*boot_class_path_supported*]
#   Whether the Java virtual machine supports the boot class path mechanism used by the bootstrap class loader to search for class files.
#
# [*spec_vendor*]
#   The Java virtual machine specification vendor. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.specification.vendor", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*name*]
#   The name representing the running Java virtual machine.
#
# [*boot_class_path*]
#   The boot class path that is used by the bootstrap class loader to search for class files. If attribute "boot-class-path-supported" is "false" or if a security manager is installed and the caller does not have ManagementPermission("monitor"), then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*spec_version*]
#   The Java virtual machine specification version. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.specification.version", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*vm_name*]
#   The Java virtual machine implementation name. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "java.vm.name", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*input_arguments*]
#   The input arguments passed to the Java virtual machine which does not include the arguments to the main method. If a security manager is installed and the caller does not have ManagementPermission("monitor"), then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
